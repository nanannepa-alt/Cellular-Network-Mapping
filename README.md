# Cellular-Network-Mapping
Mapping and analyzing cellular signal performance using geotagged data.
# Cellular Network Performance Mapping

## Project Objectives
- Collect geotagged cellular signal data (RSSI, RSRP, RSRQ, network type, cell ID).
- Visualize signal strength and coverage on interactive maps.
- Identify dead zones, handoff patterns, and performance trends.

## Design Overview
- Mobile app for data collection (Network cell Info Lite).
- Python scripts for data cleaning and transformation.
- Mapping tools (Folium) for visualization.
- GitHub repository structure for organizing raw data, processed outputs, and codebase.

## Requirements
- Mobile device with signal logging capability.
- GPS-enabled data collection.
- Python environment with pandas, geopandas, and mapping libraries.
- GitHub repo with folders:
  - `/raw_data`
  - `/processed_data`
  - `/maps`
  - `/scripts`
  - `/docs`
